# EDRED AZZIZ Real-Time Face Recognition System

## Introduction
The Real-Time Face Recognition System is a Python-based project that utilizes OpenCV and the face_recognition library to perform real-time face detection and recognition. This system captures video from a webcam, identifies known faces, and displays bounding boxes and names for recognized users.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Recognition:** The system captures video frames from the webcam and performs face recognition in real time.
- **Bounding Boxes and Labels:** Displays bounding boxes around detected faces and labels them with names if recognized. The box turns green for recognized faces and red for unrecognized faces.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to add more known faces and integrate with other systems.
