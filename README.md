# EDRED AZZIZ Real-Time Face Recognition System

## Introduction
This is a Python-based project that uses the libraries: OpenCV and face_recognition to perform real-time face detection and recognition. It captures video from a camera, identifies known faces, and projects boxes and names for recognized/unrecognzied users.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Recognition:** The system captures video frames from the webcam and performs face recognition in real time.
- **Bounding Boxes and Labels:** Displays boxes around faces and labels them with names. The box turns green for recognized faces and red for unrecognized faces.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to add more known faces and integrate with other systems. Only requires an image of the face & name

## Future Improvements
- **Optimized Performance:** Enhance the frame processing speed to reduce latency to improve real-time performance.
- **Additional Recognized Faces:** Expand the dataset to include more recognized individuals for better coverage.
- **Motion Detection:** Implement motion detection to start the program ONLY whenmovement is detected, which will ultimately conserve resources & battery life.
- **Cloud Integration:** Store and manage recognized face data & names securely in a seperate cloud for remote access and analysis.

## Conclusion
The system presented here demonstrates real-time face detection and recognition using Python & the libraries: OpenCV, and face_recognition. It offers live face identification & plans for future enhancements including performance optimization and advanced security features. This project provides a solid groundwork to build upon for future face detection applications.
