# EDRED AZZIZ Real-Time Face Recognition System

## Introduction
The Real-Time Face Recognition System is a Python-based project that utilizes OpenCV and the face_recognition library to perform real-time face detection and recognition. This system captures video from a webcam, identifies known faces, and displays bounding boxes and names for recognized users.
